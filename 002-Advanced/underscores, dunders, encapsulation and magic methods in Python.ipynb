    "# Underscores, Dunders and Everything Nice\n",
    "\n",
    "> We're going to talk about underscores, dunders, encapsulation and magic methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an easy to learn language that provides a stepping-stone into the world of programming, but some of it's features are confusing for beginners and advanced developers. At the end of this article you'll know when and how to use underscores, dunders, magic methods and encapsulation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Single and double leading (or trailing) underscores have different meanings in Python. Most of the time it's just a convention (hint to the programmer), but there are cases where they're enforced by the Python interpreter. We're going to talk about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single underscore: _\n",
    "* Single trailing underscore: foo_\n",
    "* Single leading underscore: _spam\n",
    "* Double leading underscores: __ham\n",
    "* Double leading and trailing underscores: __eggs__\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dunders\n",
    "\n",
    "Double underscores are reffered to as **dunders** because they appear quite often in Python code and it's easier to use the shorten \"dunder\" instead of \"double underscore\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unused Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A single stand-alone underscore is used to indicate that a variable is temporary or insignificant. This meaning is per convention only and doesn't trigger any special behavior in the Python parser. Single underscore is **valid variable name** that's used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're iterating and don't need access to the running index you can use `_` to indicate that it's just a temporary value:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    for _ in range(42):\n",
    "        print('Zen of Python')\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unpacking person information from a tuple (or any expression), but don't care about the eye color, you can use `_` to mark it as insignificant:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    name, age, _ = ('Pavlin', 25, 'brown')\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus feature:** In most Python REPLs the single underscore is a special variable that represents the result of the last evaluated expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keyword Collision\n",
    "\n",
    "Sooner or later one ends up using a Python keyword (class, type, list, etc.) as variable name, because it fits well in his context, but this is a bad practice and in some cases can end up in `SyntaxError`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> def foo(class, assert):\n",
    "      File \"\", line 1\n",
    "        def foo(class, assert):\n",
    "                    ^\n",
    "    SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid naming conflicts append a single underscore to the variable name:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    def foo(class_, assert_):\n",
    "        print('Zen of Python')\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Private Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The underscore prefix is used to hint the programmer that a variable or method is intended for internal use. However, this convention isn't enforced by the Python interpreter. Python does not have strong distinction between **private** and **public** variables like Java or C++:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Foo:\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.spam = 42\n",
    "            self._ham = 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> foo = Foo()\n",
    "    >>> foo.spam\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    >>> foo._ham\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to variable and method names a single leading underscore won't prevent access to them, but the leading underscore does impact how names get imported from modules:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # example.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def foo():\n",
    "        return 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def _bar():\n",
    "        return 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "If one uses a wildcard import (import *) to import all names from the module, Python **won't** import names with a leading underscore unless the module defines an `__all__` list that overrides this behavior:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> from example import *\n",
    "    >>> foo()\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    >>> _bar()\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "      File \"\", line 1, in \n",
    "    NameError: name '_bar' is not defined\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike wildcard imports, regular imports are not affected by the leading single underscore naming convention:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> from example import foo, _bar\n",
    "    >>> foo()\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    >>> _bar()\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Wildcard imports should be avoided at all cost as they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Name mangling\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the naming patterns so far were agreed-upon conventions only, but things are a little bit different with Python attributes that start with double underscores. A dunder prefix causes the Python interpreter to rewrite the attribute name in order to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses, also called **name mangling**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Foo:\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.spam = 42\n",
    "            self._ham = 42\n",
    "            self.__eggs = 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> foo = Foo()\n",
    "    >>> foo.spam\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    >>> foo._ham\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    >>> foo.__eggs\n",
    "    Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "      File \"\", line 1, in \n",
    "    AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute '__eggs'\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "What happened? Let's take a look at the attributes of the foo object using the built-in `dir` function:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> dir(foo)\n",
    "    ['_Foo__eggs', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_ham', 'spam']\n",
    "    >>> foo._Foo__eggs\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely you'll find out there's an attribute called `_Foo__eggs`. This is the name mangling Python interpreter applies to protect the variable from being overridden in subclasses:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    class ExtendsFoo(Foo):\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            super().__init__()\n",
    "            self.spam = 1.618\n",
    "            self._ham = 1.618\n",
    "            self.__eggs = 1.618\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> golden_foo = ExtendsFoo()\n",
    "    >>> dir(golden_foo)\n",
    "    ['_ExtendsFoo__eggs', '_Foo__eggs', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_ham', 'spam']\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "`_Foo__eggs` still exists as an attribute of the new object, that extended `class Foo`, and there's the new overridden `__eggs` attribute as `_ExtendsFoo__eggs`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> golden_foo.spam\n",
    "    1.618\n",
    "    >>> golden_foo._ham\n",
    "    1.618\n",
    "    >>> better_foo._ExtendsFoo__eggs\n",
    "    1.618\n",
    "    >>> better_foo._Foo__eggs\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation in Python **lacks** strict access control such as private and protected attributes. It will stop you from accidentally accesing _stuff_, but you can intentionally do pretty much everything as long as you're aware how the language works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above we used attributes, but the same rules apply for method names also. In short _name mangling affects all names that start with two underscore characters in a class context_. Having that in mind let's take a look at another example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # example.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "    _Foo__mangled = 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Foo:\n",
    "        def bar(self):\n",
    "            return __mangled\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> foo = Foo()\n",
    "    >>> foo.bar()\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Why did it work? As we just said the Python interpreter expanded the name `__mangled` to `_Foo__mangled` because it begins with dunder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Magic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Something I didn't mention in the _italic_ text above is name mangling **is not** applied if a name **starts and ends** with double underscores:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Foo:\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            self.__spam__ = 42\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> foo = Foo()\n",
    "    >>> foo.__spam__\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods that have both leading and trailing double underscores are reserved for special use in the language. These dunders are often referred to as **magic methods** even thought they have nothing to do with wizardry. Magic methods are called behind the scenes when certain circumstances occur. For example when you create an instance of class the necessary calls to `__new__` and `__init__` are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as far as naming conventions go, it's best to **stay away** from using names that start and end with double underscores to avoid collision with future changes in the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, **use**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Single underscore to discard variables\n",
    "* Single trailing underscore to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords\n",
    "* Single leading underscore to indicate a name is meant for internal use\n",
    "* Double leading underscore to avoid naming conflicts and overridding in subclasses\n",
    "* Double leading and trailing underscore for special methods defined in Python only\n",
